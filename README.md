# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
Use neural network to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting applicant success if funded by client


## Overview of Project
  ### Purpose
   Client has requested a neural network binary classifier to predict if applicant projects will be successful if funded.  This will allow the client to invest in succesful projects and increase impact.  
  
  ### Deliverables
   - D1: Preprocess data for a neural network
   - D2: Compile, train, and evaluate the model
   - D3: Optimize the model
   - D4: Written report
   
  ### Resources
   - Data Sources: charity_data.csv
   - Technology:  Jupyter Notebook, Python 3.7

## Results
  ### Overview of Code
  
  ### Data Preprocessing results
   - What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
   - What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
   - What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
  ### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
   - How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
   - Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
   - What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
  
## Summary
  ### Conclusions
  ### Limitations
  ### Additional Analysis - different model
